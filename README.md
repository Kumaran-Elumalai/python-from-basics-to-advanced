# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Kumaran Elumalai

I'm an **AI/ML Engineer** and a **data enthusiast** passionate about solving real-world problems using data and machine learning. I enjoy building projects, experimenting with AI models, and continuously learning new technologies.

## ðŸ“š About This Repository

This repository, [python-from-basics-to-advanced](https://github.com/Kumaran-Elumalai/python-from-basics-to-advanced), is my **Python learning journal**.  
While my main work is in AI/ML, Python is the backbone of my projects â€” and this repo documents my journey from Python fundamentals to advanced concepts through **structured notebooks and practical examples**.

## ðŸš€ My Learning Philosophy

> "Consistency is the key to mastery."

I believe in learning by doing. Every notebook, example, and experiment here represents a step in building strong foundations for AI/ML projects and data-driven solutions.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies & Tools

- Python 3.x (core for AI/ML & data projects)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Machine Learning & Data Science libraries (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, etc.)  
- Git & GitHub  

## ðŸ“ˆ Letâ€™s Connect

Feel free to explore my repositories, collaborate on AI/ML projects, or discuss data-driven solutions.  

Happy coding & experimenting with AI! ðŸ¤–
