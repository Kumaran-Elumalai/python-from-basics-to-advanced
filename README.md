# 🐍 Python: From Basics to Advanced


👋 Hi, I'm **Kumaran Elumalai**  
An **AI/ML Engineer** and a **data enthusiast** passionate about solving real-world problems using data and machine learning. I enjoy building projects, experimenting with AI models, and continuously learning new technologies.

## 📚 About This Repository
This repository, [python-from-basics-to-advanced](https://github.com/Kumaran-Elumalai/python-from-basics-to-advanced), is my **Python learning journal**.  

While my main work is in **AI/ML**, Python is the **backbone of everything I build**.  
Here, I document my journey from **Python fundamentals** to **advanced concepts** through:  
- Structured notebooks  
- Coding practice problems  
- Interview preparation notes  

The goal is twofold:  
- 📖 Strengthen my own Python foundations for AI/ML & data projects  
- 🌍 Build a resource others can learn from

## 🚀 My Learning Philosophy

> "Consistency is the key to mastery."

I believe in **learning by doing**.  
Every notebook, problem, and interview note here represents a step in becoming a stronger **engineer and problem solver**.
