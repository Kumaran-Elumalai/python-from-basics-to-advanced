# 📘 Python Fundamentals : Day-wise Learning Summary

This module covers Python from **absolute basics to strong core foundations**, designed for **learning, practice, and interview preparation**.  
Each day builds logically on the previous one.

## 📅 Day 1 – Python Basics & Foundations
### Key Takeaways
- Python basics: simple, readable, cross-platform language
- Indentation defines code blocks (no braces)
- Input & Output: `input()`, `print()`, multiple inputs, type casting
- Variables & object references: variables point to objects in memory
- Keywords: reserved words with special meaning
- Clear distinction between variables, keywords, and identifiers

## 📅 Day 2 – Data Types, Operators & Conditionals
### Key Takeaways
- Data Types:
  - Numeric, Strings, Boolean
  - Introduction to list, tuple, set, dictionary
- Operators:
  - Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical
  - Bitwise, Assignment
  - Identity, Membership, Ternary
- Conditional Statements:
  - `if`, `if-else`, `elif`
  - Nested conditions
  - Shorthand (ternary)
  - `match-case`

## 📅 Day 3 – Loops & Control Flow
### Key Takeaways
- `for` loop for iterating over sequences
- `while` loop for condition-based repetition
- Nested loops for multi-level iterations
- Loop control statements:
  - `break`, `continue`, `pass`
- `else` with loops (executes only if no `break` occurs)

---
## 📅 Day 4 – Functions & Recursion
### Key Takeaways
- Defining and calling functions
- Parameters, arguments, and return values
- Pass by value vs pass by reference
- Nested functions for logical organization
- Lambda (anonymous) functions
- Recursion fundamentals:
  - Base case importance
  - Tail vs non-tail recursion
- Recursion vs iteration and when to prefer each
