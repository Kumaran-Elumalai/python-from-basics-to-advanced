## 📅 Day 1 – Python Basics & Foundations
### Topics Covered
- Python basics: simple, readable, cross-platform language
- Indentation defines code blocks (no braces)
- Input & Output: `input()`, `print()`, multiple inputs, type casting
- Variables & object references: variables point to objects in memory
- Keywords: reserved words with special meaning
- Clear distinction between variables, keywords, and identifiers

## 📅 Day 2 – Data Types, Operators & Conditionals
### Topics Covered
- Data Types:
  - Numeric, Strings, Boolean
  - Introduction to list, tuple, set, dictionary
- Operators:
  - Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical
  - Bitwise, Assignment
  - Identity, Membership, Ternary
- Conditional Statements:
  - `if`, `if-else`, `elif`
  - Nested conditions
  - Shorthand (ternary)
  - `match-case`

---
## 📅 Day 3 – Loops & Control Flow
### Topics Covered
- `for` loop for iterating over sequences
- `while` loop for condition-based repetition
- Nested loops for multi-level iterations
- Loop control statements:
  - `break`, `continue`, `pass`
- `else` with loops (executes only if no `break` occurs)

---
## 📅 Day 4 – Functions & Recursion
### Topics Covered
- Defining and calling functions
- Parameters, arguments, and return values
- Pass by value vs pass by reference
- Nested functions for logical organization
- Lambda (anonymous) functions
- Recursion fundamentals:
  - Base case importance
  - Tail vs non-tail recursion
- Recursion vs iteration and when to prefer each

---

## 📅 Day 5 – Functional Programming & Decorators
### Topics Covered
- Functional tools:
  - `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, `accumulate()`
- First-class and higher-order functions
- Decorators:
  - Internal working of decorators
  - Extending behavior without modifying original functions
- Types of decorators:
  - Function, Method, Class
- Built-in decorators:
  - `@staticmethod`, `@classmethod`, `@property`
- Chaining multiple decorators
- Real-world use cases:
  - Logging
  - Authentication
  - Caching
  - Rate limiting
  - Retry logic

 ---

## 📅 Day 6 – Strings & Text Processing
### Topics Covered
- Strings as immutable text data
- Indexing from both left and right
- Slicing for substrings and reversing text
- Core string operations:
  - Concatenation, repetition, membership, iteration
- Common string methods:
  - Cleaning, searching, splitting, joining, transforming
- String formatting techniques:
  - f-strings
  - `format()`
  - `%` formatting
- Escape sequences for special characters
- Practical exercises:
  - Reversing strings
  - Palindrome checks
  - Character validation

---

## 📅 Day 7 – Lists & Tuples
### Topics Covered
- Lists:
  - Mutable and dynamic
  - Best for changing data
- Tuples:
  - Immutable and lightweight
  - Best for fixed or structured data
- Shared capabilities:
  - Indexing, slicing, iteration
  - Mixed data types
- Lists offer rich methods; tuples are intentionally minimal
- Tuples often perform better due to immutability

---
## 📅 Day 8 – Sets & Dictionaries
### Topics Covered
- Unordered collection of unique elements
- Set creation, mutability, and constraints
- Core methods:
  - `add`, `update`, `remove`, `discard`, `pop`, `clear`
- Set operations:
  - Union, Intersection, Difference, Symmetric Difference
- Set relations:
  - Subset, Superset, Disjoint
- Set comprehensions for efficient transformations
- `frozenset` for immutability
- Hashing fundamentals and O(1) average lookup time
- Real-world use cases:
  - Duplicate removal
  - Fast membership checks
  - Log analysis
  - Tag filtering

### 🔹 Dictionaries
- Key–value data structure fundamentals
- Creation, access, modification, and deletion
- Safe access patterns:
  - `get()`
  - Key existence checks
  - `setdefault()`
- Core methods:
  - `keys`, `values`, `items`, `copy`, `fromkeys`
- Looping patterns for data processing
- Dictionary comprehensions
- Nested dictionaries (JSON-like structures, API responses)
- Dictionary memory model and hashing
- Advanced concepts:
  - Tuple keys
  - Dictionary merging (`|`)
  - `OrderedDict`, `defaultdict`
- Real-world applications:
  - Frequency counting
  - Configuration management
  - Lookup tables
  - User data tracking
