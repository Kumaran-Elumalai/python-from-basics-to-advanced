    "If you’ve made it this far through variables, loops, and conditionals, give yourself a little pat on the back (or maybe a coffee). You’ve built the foundation; now it’s time to make your code smarter and more reusable.\n",

    "Today, we’re entering the world of **functions**, the secret sauce that turns repetitive code into clean, efficient, and elegant programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this day, you’ll not only understand what functions are but also how to **create**, **call**, and **enhance** them with arguments, return values, and a few pro tips that’ll make you look like a Python expert.\n"
