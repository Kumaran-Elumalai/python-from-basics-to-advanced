    "\n",
    "#### Numeric Types\n",
    "- **int** → Whole numbers (e.g., `5`, `-42`)  \n",
    "- **float** → Decimal numbers (e.g., `3.14`, `-0.001`)  \n",
    "- **complex** → Numbers with a real and imaginary part (e.g., `2 + 3j`)  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sequence Types\n",
    "- **str** → Strings, i.e., text (e.g., `\"Hello\"`)  \n",
    "- **list** → Ordered, changeable collection (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`)  \n",
    "- **tuple** → Ordered, unchangeable collection (e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`)  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mapping Type\n",
    "- **dict** → Key-value pairs (e.g., `{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25}`)  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Boolean Type\n",
    "- **bool** → `True` or `False`  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Set Types\n",
    "- **set** → Unordered collection of unique items (e.g., `{1, 2, 3}`)  \n",
    "- **frozenset** → Like set, but immutable (cannot be changed once created)  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Binary Types\n",
    "- **bytes** → Immutable sequence of bytes  \n",
    "- **bytearray** → Mutable sequence of bytes  \n",
    "- **memoryview** → A way to access the memory of binary objects  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine data types as different kinds of “boxes”  you wouldn’t store milk in a toolbox, right?  \n",
    "Similarly, Python chooses the right “box” (data type) to keep things organized.\n"
